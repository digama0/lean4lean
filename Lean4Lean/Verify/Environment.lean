/-- The intended main theorem of the `Verify` development, currently unproved:
if `env` is well-formed and `addDecl env decl` (in checking mode) succeeds,
then the resulting environment is also well-formed, and it extends `env`.

None of the pieces of this theorem exist yet: nothing relates
`Lean.Kernel.Environment.add` to the `TrEnv` relation, and nothing repackages
the `checkType.WF`/`isDefEq.WF` postconditions at the empty local context into
the abstract `VDecl.WF` premises needed to extend `TrEnv`. -/
